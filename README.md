## Cloud Native Development in Practice - 10.04.26

Introduction into the practical side of cloud native development:

- Frameworks
  - General Idea
  - Benefits
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring ecosystem
- Interservice Communication
  - Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication
  - REST
  - Resources, Verbs and Representations
  - Richardson Maturity Model

### Questions for Exam Preparation

- With the basic Rest Controller having a local `ArrayList` as storage of `TodoItem`s: what are potential issues in the long run, where does this conflict with concepts we learned about?

## Containerisation

Introduction into packaging applications as containers:

- Problem with running applications directly on a host
  - different machines may have different Java versions, tools or system libraries
  - manual setup is hard to reproduce
  - deployments become dependent on the local environment
  - scaling and replacing instances becomes harder
- Container image
  - packaged application plus runtime dependencies
  - built once and started many times
  - usually created from a `Dockerfile` or build tool plugin
  - consists of layers that can be cached and reused
- Container
  - running instance of an image
  - isolated process with its own filesystem, network view and environment
  - can be started, stopped, removed and recreated
- Dockerfile
  - describes how to build an image
  - chooses a base image
  - copies the application artifact
  - defines the command used to start the application
- Ports and networking
  - Spring Boot usually listens on port `8080` inside the container
  - host-to-container port mapping makes the application reachable from outside
  - containers can communicate through container networks
- Configuration
  - environment variables are commonly used for runtime settings
  - datasource URLs, active profiles and secrets should not be hardcoded into the image
  - same image can be used in different environments with different configuration
- Container registry
  - storage location for container images
  - examples are Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry or a private registry
  - deployment platforms pull images from registries
- Cloud native perspective
  - containers support reproducible deployment
  - application instances should be stateless where possible
  - persistent state belongs in external databases or managed storage
  - containers are the basis for orchestration platforms like Kubernetes

Basic example workflow:

```bash
docker build -t starterapp .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 starterapp
```

### Questions for Exam Preparation

- What problem does containerisation solve compared to installing an application directly on a server?
- What is the difference between a container image and a running container?
- What is the purpose of a `Dockerfile`?
- Why should a container image not contain environment-specific secrets or database URLs?
- What does port mapping do when running a web application in a container?
- Why are containers often described as disposable?
- What happens to data stored only inside a container when the container is removed?
- Why should persistent state usually be stored outside the application container?
- What is a container registry, and why is it useful in deployment pipelines?
- How does containerisation support cloud native principles such as scalability and reproducibility?

## Persistence - 08.05.26

Introduction into moving the TODO application from local memory towards persistence:

- Problem with local `ArrayList` storage
  - data is lost after restart
  - state is tied to one application instance
  - multiple replicas would not share the same data
  - controller mixes HTTP handling and storage logic
- Persistence
  - storing data beyond the lifetime of one process
  - keeping application instances mostly stateless
  - moving durable state into a database
- Spring Boot application structure
  - `TodoController` handles HTTP requests and REST status codes
  - `TodoService` contains application logic
  - `TodoRepository` handles database access
  - `TodoItem` represents persistent data as a JPA entity
- JDBC
  - low-level Java API for database connections, SQL statements and result sets
  - powerful but often verbose when used directly
- JPA and Hibernate
  - JPA maps Java objects to relational database tables
  - Hibernate is the JPA implementation used by Spring Boot
  - `@Entity`, `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue` describe how `TodoItem` is stored
- Spring Data JPA
  - repository abstraction on top of JPA
  - provides methods like `findAll`, `findById`, `save`, `deleteById` and `existsById`
  - reduces boilerplate persistence code
- H2 database
  - lightweight database for local development and tests
  - file-based H2 can keep local application data
  - in-memory H2 is useful for isolated automated tests
- Production perspective
  - external databases such as PostgreSQL or MySQL are more realistic for deployed systems
  - datasource configuration can be changed without rewriting the controller or service layer

Basic repository example:

```java
public interface TodoRepository extends JpaRepository<TodoItem, Integer> {
}
```

### Questions for Exam Preparation

- Why is local in-memory state problematic when an application is restarted, redeployed, or scaled to multiple instances?
- What is the responsibility of a controller, service, repository, and entity in a typical Spring Boot application?
- What problem does persistence solve compared to storing data in a local Java collection?
- What does `JpaRepository<TodoItem, Integer>` provide automatically?
- Why should a database usually be external to application instances in a cloud native or distributed system?
- What is the difference between using H2 for local development or tests and using a production database such as PostgreSQL?
- Why is it useful to keep tests on an in-memory database instead of the application's file-based local database?

## Containers Extended and Persistence for Containers - 15.05.26

In this session we extended the persistance capabilites of the TODO application by moving from a local H2 database to a PostgreSQL database running in a separate container. The application and the database were connected through environment variables provided through application configration and the Docker run command.

### Running PostgreSQL as a container

PostgreSQL can be started as a separate container:

```bash
docker run --name some-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres -d postgres:14.19
```

The command above starts PostgreSQL and publishes port `5432` to the host. This is useful when the application runs directly on the host or when we want to connect with a local database client.

This is closer to a real distributed application because the application process and the database process run separately and communicate over the network.
